'''
(5 points) Implement κ-means yourself. Your function should take in an array containing
a dataset and a value of κ, and return the cluster centroids along with the cluster
assignment for each data point. You may choose the initialization heuristic of your
choice among the two we saw in class. Hand-in the code for full credit. For this
question, you should not rely on any library other than numPy in Python.
